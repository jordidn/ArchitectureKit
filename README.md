# ArchitectureKit

## Project Objectives

### 1. Demonstrate Clean Architecture
Structure the project so that each layer (such as **UI**, **Interaction**, **Domain**, and **Data**) is well-defined and follows proper dependency rules. The goal is for each layer to be easy to understand, test, and maintain, following a modular and scalable architecture.

### 2. Apply SOLID Principles
Implement each component according to **SOLID principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

This encourages more flexible and decoupled code.

### 3. Facilitate Unit and Integration Testing
The structured separation of responsibilities will enable efficient **unit** and **integration testing**, maximizing code coverage without affecting development performance.

### 4. Enhance Team Understanding
This sample project aims to provide the team with a **practical and replicable model** that facilitates learning and adoption of **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID principles** in iOS development with Swift.

This project serves as a practical, accessible guide for the entire team, supporting a transition to cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code.
